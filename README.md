# Model Notes
This model represents a concentration gradient of RanGTP across the nuclear
envelope. This gradient is generated by distribution of regulators of
RanGTPase. We have taken a log linear plot of graphs generated by GENESIS and
compared with the experimental graphs.

This model originates from BioModels Database: A Database of Annotated
Published Models. It is copyright (c) 2005-2008 The BioModels Team.
