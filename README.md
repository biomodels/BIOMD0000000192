# BIOMD0000000192: RanGTP_gradient

## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000192.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000192.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000192 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes
This model represents a concentration gradient of RanGTP across the nuclear
envelope. This gradient is generated by distribution of regulators of
RanGTPase. We have taken a log linear plot of graphs generated by GENESIS and
compared with the experimental graphs.

This model originates from BioModels Database: A Database of Annotated
Published Models. It is copyright (c) 2005-2008 The BioModels Team.
